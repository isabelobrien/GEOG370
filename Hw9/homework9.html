<h1>Homework 9: Choropleth Map </h1>
<h2>Isabel O'Brien</h2>
<h3>This map shows the percentage of people in each state in 2019 
    who are fully vaccinated. I wanted to make this map because
    COVID and the increased presence of anti-vax communities 
    made me wonder what percentage of people are getting vaccinated. I noticed that sates in New England particularly (with generally denser populations), as well as some others that seemed more random, had the highest rates of vaccination. More rural states tended to generally have lower rates of vaccination.   </h3>
