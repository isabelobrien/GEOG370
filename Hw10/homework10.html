<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Isabel O'Brien</h2>
<h3> I wanted to make this map becuase my dad often likes to get 
    coffee when we go on bike rides, and I wanted to display which bike 
trails were close to a Starbucks. To do this, I found data showing the
locations of every Starbucks in the US, the greenway trails in Wake
County, and an outline of Wake County itself. I then used the buffer
tool to create buffers around each Starbucks location with a radius of
1,000 feet. I then used the intersection tool to highlight where
these buffers overlapped with the trails. The result was a map that
clearly shows which trails we can ride on and still easily get coffee!  </h3>
