<h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Isabel O'Brien</h2>

<h3>For this assignment, I was curious to see the percentages of people in 
    Pennsylvania over the age of 25 for which a high school degree was their 
    highest degree recieved. The ratio that I made was [(total number of 
    people in a county whose highest degree was a high school diploma / 
    total population for that county) * 100]. This is different from the data 
    I used in homework 7 (that data had counties missing and also did not 
    translate well to a ratio), so a simple population map is at the bottom 
    of this page for reference.</h3>

<h3>Equal Interval </h3>
<h4>Equal Interval is a method of classification in which the range of each category 
    is the same (in this map, the range of each is 7%). This is best for data that 
    is very evenly distributed, with no large clumps of data in any one interval. 
    This map is potentially the most straightforward to understand when first looking 
    at it, but does not provide as much detail as it could (for example, a majority of 
    counties on this map fall into the 42-49% category). </h4>

<h3>Equal Count (Quantile)</h3>
<h4>Equal Count is a method of classification in which each category has a similar number 
    of data points (in this case, counties). This is similar to Equal Interval, but 
    accounts for possible clumping of data by evening out the size of the categories. 
    For example, the category represented by the second-darkest shade of purple that 
    was so prevalent in the previous map has now been redistributed. Trends are easier 
    to see at first glance because less of the map is the same color. However, since the 
    categories do not all have the same range, this map is harder to fully understand 
    without reading the key. </h4>

<h3>Natural Breaks </h3>
<h4>Natural Breaks is a method of classification in which clusters of data are taken 
    into account. The data will be sorted into categories based on patterns in the data, 
    not based on the range or size of the invervals themselves. Because of this, the 
    map is fairly accurate when you are glancing at it to see trends, but this mode 
    could also result in categories with either very large or very small ranges, 
    depending on the data being used. </h4>

<h3>Total Population </h3>
<h4>Since I used different data here than I did in Homework 7, here is a map of Pennsylvania counties showing total number of people who only recieved a high school degree for reference. I thought it was interesting how clearly these maps show that less populated counties are generally correlated with lower average levels of education.</h4>
